\section{Rationale}
Since this software interacts with an external entity with API limitations, we
had to make some adjustments to the specifications. Since the API limits the
number of calls per minute, thus, the software is unable to make enough API
calls in under a minute to gather the required information on 10 stocks. So,
we thought it more correct to stall the program until it received information
on all 10 stocks instead of proceeding with information on a limited number of
stocks. The runtime of this software is primarily bounded by the API
limitations, but does produce the correct result (assuming stock prices
haven't changed during the runtime of the program). Other than the decision to
stall the program until all the stocks have been received, there aren't really
any unique design decisions to note.

\section{Testing}
A simple Unit test was written to verify the correctness of the function we

\section{Defects}

The biggest fault of the program is that there is an API key limitation in that
it can only get 5 stock prices every minute. This is problematic, because there
is 10 stocks the program is to check. That means it will take at least a minute
to run regardless of how the code is designed. This delay greatly overshadows
any other aspect of the code.
