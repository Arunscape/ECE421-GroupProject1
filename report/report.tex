\section{Rationale}
Since this software interacts with an external entity with API limitations, we
had to make some adjustments to the specifications. Since the API limits the
number of calls per minute, thus, the software is unable to make enough API
calls in under a minute to gather the required information on 10 stocks. So,
we thought it more correct to stall the program until it reviced information
on all 10 stocks instead of proceeding with information on a limited number of
stocks. The runtime of this software is primarily bounded by the API
limitations, but does produce the correct result (assuming stock prices
havent changed during the runtime of the program).

In the event that there are two stocks with the highest price we arbitrarily
pick one of the stocks and return that.

The functional features of Java we used were effectivley, maps, reduces,
filters, and lambdas. Thus the pickShareFunctional method ends up effectively
being a one-liner with no local variables.

\section{Testing}
A simple Unit test was written to verify the correctness of the function we

\section{Defects}

The biggest fault of the program is that there is an API key limitation in that
it can only get 5 stock prices every minute. This is problematic, because there
is 10 stocks the program is to check. That means it will take at least a minute
to run regardless of how the code is designed. This delay greatly overshadows
any other aspect of the code.
