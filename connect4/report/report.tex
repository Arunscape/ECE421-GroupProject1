\section{Design}
\subsection{What can we do on a computer than we canâ€™t do on a printed board?}

\subsection{What is a computerized opponent? What are its objectives?}
- What characteristics should it possess? Do we need an opponent or opponents?


\subsection{What design choices exist for the Interface components?}
- Color? Font? Dimensions of Windows? Rescale-ability? Scroll Bars? \dots

\subsection{What does exception handling mean in a GUI system?}

\subsection{Do we require a command-line interface for debugging purposes?}
Yes, because\dots

\subsection{What are Model-View-Controller and Model-View-Viewmodel? Are either applicable to your
design?}

Model-View-Controller is a software design pattern, commonly used for user interfaces. 
The model contains the data structure, the view takes care of how to display the model,
and the controller handles updates to the model and tells the view when to update.

Model-View-Viewmodel is another software design pattern. The model and view is similar to model-view-controller.
However, the viewmodel meaning the view model is responsible for converting the data objects from the model in such 
a way that the objects can be easily presented. 

Our application uses the Yew framework, a rust web framework based on Elm, which uses the model
view controller architecture. Our web components have a Model struct, a Message enum, and the
struct implementation has a view() function which returns html elements, while the update() 
method determines whether or not the component needs to re-render and how the model should be updated
based on the message passed to it.



\section{Innovations (Additional to the specification)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile friendliness
    \item Online multiplayer.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Users can be on different computers
            \item Users can even leave mid-game and continue later.
            \item Users can leave and continue playing on a different computer
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Secure sign in. Passwords are hashed using argon2. JSON Web tokens are used to ensure a user
        is authorized 
    \item Online deployment. The games are available to play at \url{http://connect4.woosaree.xyz}
    \item Continuous Integration and Deployment. Builds are automatically done when code is pushed,
        which will publish updated images to DockerHub on success \url{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arunscape/connect4-server}
        the updated image is then pulled, and deployed automatically to \url{http://connect4.woosaree.xyz}
    \item Published on crates.io
        
\end{enumerate}

\section{Rationale}

\section{Defects}
No known defects.

From a security standpoint, it would be more ideal to serve the site with TLS encryption over HTTPS,
however, we had issues with enabling non-default features in the rocket library.

\section{Remaining MEAN stack code}
The only thing left over from the MEAN stack is mongodb. Everything else has been written
in Rust and WebAssembly. In a project with over 5000 lines of code,
less than 40 lines are HTML + JavaScript.
